Motivations
-------

In my current job but also in past jobs, I often came across the recurring need of our clients to have qualitative insights on their social media presence.
I am used to provide quantitative insights based on classic KPIs such as reach, impressions, engagement, etc. But what is trickier is to build a story to the client
with qualitative insights without doing it manually (it takes a lot of time!). For example, some clients want to understand the communication strategy of their
competitors in order to stand out from them. Do they have a specific tone of voice? Do they use the same set of colors to communicate?

This is how I got the idea to work on this project! The objective is to create a **color clustering tool which will extract the most used colors of an Instagram page**.

This article helped me to build the K-Means clustering algorithm to extract the top colors of an image:

I found this article which was quite similar with what I had in mind for this project. This helped me to build the methodology to merge the data of all the pictures
of an Instagram page.
